Welcome to my blog. I am a machine learning engineer with over 20 years of experience. I have worked with innovative companies such as Airbnb and GitHub, which included early LLM research used by OpenAI for code understanding. I have also led and contributed to numerous popular open-source machine-learning tools. I am currently an independent consultant helping companies operationalize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate their AI product journey.

## Get In Touch

Do you need help operationalizing ML or large language models? Iâ€™m open to new consulting work and other forms of advisory. If you need help with your project, send me a brief email at [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com).
